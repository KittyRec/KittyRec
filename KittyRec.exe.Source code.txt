We used a program called Bat to Exe to create the KittySec executable.
 However, it occasionally gets flagged due to how it's compiled. If you'd like to compile it yourself, hereâ€™s the exact script just convert this file to a bat :


@echo off
cd data
cls
color 5
echo.
echo 888    d8P  d8b 888    888             8888888b.
